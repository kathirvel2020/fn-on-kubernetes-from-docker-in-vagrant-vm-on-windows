# 1A. download and install Fn locally inside the VM
curl -LSs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fnproject/cli/master/install | sh

#note: this previous statement failed for me; I went through the following steps as a workaround
# 1B. create install script
curl -LSs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fnproject/cli/master/install > inst
all.sh
# make script executable
chmod u+x install.sh
# execute script - as sudo
sudo ./install.sh

# 1C. and if that fails, you can manually manipulate the downloaded executable:
sudo mv /tmp/fn_linux /usr/local/bin/fn
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/fn

# 2. when the installation was done through one of the  methods listed, test the success by running  
fn --version


# 3. Server side installation of Fn to the Kubernetes Cluster
# details in https://github.com/fnproject/fn-helm

# Clone the GitHub repo with the Helm chart for fn; sources are downloaded into the fn-helm directory
git clone git@github.com:fnproject/fn-helm.git && cd fn-helm

# Install chart dependencies from requirements.yaml in the fn-helm directory:
helm dep build fn

#To install the Helm chart with the release name my-release into Kubernetes:
helm install --name my-release fn

# to verify the cluster server side installation you could run the following statements:
export KUBECONFIG=/vagrant/kubeconfig

#list all pods for app my-release-fn
kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app=my-release-fn"
